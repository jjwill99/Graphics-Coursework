This interface shows a dart flying through the air and hitting a dart board.
Also in the scene is: a table, a drinks bar, a drinks shelf, ceiling lights, moving rings and a star flying around the dart.

The main object is a dart. I created it using a cylinder for the grip, a cylinder for the spike, a sphere for the back end and a custom object for the fins.

When I press the space bar the dart will begin moving.
While it is moving, I can control the dart by using the w, a, s, d keys.

During flight, the lights change colour and effect the whole scene.

When the dart hits the board, it stops the dart, and I can press r to reset the interface.

If the dart gets close to the edge of the screen, the scene moves so that the dart does not move out of view.
